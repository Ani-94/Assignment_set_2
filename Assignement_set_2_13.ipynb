    "Q1. Can you create a programme or function that employs both positive and negative indexing? Is there any repercussion if you do so?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as extracting the elements are concerned both the approaches can be used, but if a particular element is to be extracted or elements in a particular order is to be extracted then such function would have indexing issues, since the positive indexing uses positive number starting from 0 to index while negative indexing uses negative number from the end of the iterate starting from -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the index value of an element in positive indexing is different from negative indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the most effective way of starting with 1,000 elements in a Python list? Assume that all elements should be set to the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "for loop or while loop\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3. How do you slice a list to get any other part while missing the rest? (For example, suppose you want to make a new list with the elements first, third, fifth, seventh, and so on.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "By mentioning the intervals after which the elements are to be skipped\n",
    "Fo above eaxmple. For a list l\n",
    "\n",
    "l[0::2]\n",
    "here the index of 1st element is 0 and teh blank signifies teh end of list and 2 specifies that after every 2nd element is to be skipped \n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain the distinctions between indexing and slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing is used to read an element at that index, while slicing creates a sub string of any string \n",
    "\n",
    "We can extract data at the mentioned within the indexed range, while using slicing a series of characters can be extracted\n",
    "\n",
    "In indexing when a range of n1 to n2 is mentioned the n2th character is skipped, while slicing removes every characters as in input string or index renge\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What happens if one of the slicing expression's indexes is out of range?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns an empty sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. If you pass a list to a function, and if you want the function to be able to change the values of the list—so that the list is different after the function returns—what action should you avoid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning the input list\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the concept of an unbalanced matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "If number of cells in a matrix is greater than the value of the cell, then the matrix is said to be unstable\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Why is it necessary to use either list comprehension or a loop to create arbitrarily large matrices?\n",
