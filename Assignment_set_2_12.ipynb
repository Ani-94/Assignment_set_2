    "Q1. Does assigning a value to a string's indexed character violate Python's string immutability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "It does violate the immutability of string, but the updated string can be re assigned to the variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Does using the += operator to concatenate strings violate Python's string immutability? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not violate the immutability of strings since the contents of strings are not replaced by index, the operator simply adds the new string to the existing string in the variable, but the old variable value is not manipulated\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In Python, how many different ways are there to index a character?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "2 ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Accessing characters by positive indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Accessing characters by negative indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the relationship between indexing and slicing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing is determine the subset of a string based on the indices values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is an indexed character's exact data type? What is the data form of a slicing-generated substring?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The indexed character data type will be string\n",
    "\n",
    "String\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the relationship between string and character \"types\" in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "String is an array of bytes of unicode characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Identify at least two operators and one method that allow you to combine one or more smaller strings to create a larger string.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "operators: +, =+\n",
    "\n",
    "method: concatenate()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is the benefit of first checking the target string with in or not in before using the index method to find a substring?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduces the number of for loop required to find the match between the indexed character and substring\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Which operators and built-in string methods produce simple Boolean (true/false) results?\n",
