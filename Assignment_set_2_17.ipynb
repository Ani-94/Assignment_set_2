    "Q1. Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words as possible.\n",
    "What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one? \n",
    "What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Greedy syntax takes the available best model to evaluate and does not think whether an overall best result is achieved\n",
    "    or not\n",
    "    To convert the greedy to non greedy the '*' should be followed by '?' and '*' to be removed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. When exactly does greedy versus non-greedy make a difference? \n",
    "What if you're looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The greedy will wait for initial match and returns but if the rest of the expressions are to be compared then\n",
    "    we would need non-greedy\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In a simple match of a string, which looks only for one match and does not do any replacement,\n",
    "is the use of a nontagged group likely to make any practical difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    No it does not \n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Describe a scenario in which using a nontagged category would have a significant impact on the program's outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    To capture minor groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Unlike a normal regex pattern, a look-ahead condition does not consume the characters it examines.\n",
    "Describe a situation in which this could make a difference in the results of your programme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    It best used when the search string is to find any possible match ahead in the string\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. In standard expressions, what is the difference between positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    Positive look ahead will look for the presence of the pattern ahead but search for matc, while the negative look ahead\n",
    " absence of the string in the search string   \n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the benefit of referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    The partial search for numbers during greedy sntax would result in wrong search\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Can you identify repeated items within a target string using named groups, as in \"The cow jumped over the moon\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. When parsing a string, what is at least one thing that the Scanner interface does for you that the re.findall \n",
    "feature does not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    Scans through a non alphanumerical text also\n",
