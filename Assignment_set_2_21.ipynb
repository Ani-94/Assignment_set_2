    "Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability helps you determine probable outcomes \n",
    "Since python  uses Psuedo random values, it is possible to predict the upcoming values\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "True random number generators uses unpredictable strategies while pseudo-random number generators use mathematical algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of high prediction of mathematical model makes pseudo-random generators preferrable\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the two main factors that influence the behaviour of a \"normal\" probability distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean and standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights in a weight lifting machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "It tends to stability and as the number of trial go the variance expand\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What kind of object can be shuffled by using random.shuffle?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",

    "Q8. What is the relationship between exponentiation and logarithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "logarithm is the inverse function of exponentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What are the three logarithmic functions that Python supports?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "log to base 10\n",
    "\n",
    "normal logarithmic\n",
